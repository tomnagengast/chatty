@specs/ui.md
@fix_plan.md
@CLAUDE.md

INSTRUCTIONS
- Follow CLAUDE.md instructions strictly (no placeholders, minimal compiling diffs)
- Select the first unblocked task from fix_plan.md
- Make the smallest viable change; produce unified diffs
- Prepare a validator payload with exact build/test/lint commands
- If acceptance clarifies or a prerequisite emerges, patch only that task block in fix_plan.md

OUTPUT
Return a structured JSON object with:
- selected_task_id: The task ID you're working on
- why_this_task: One-sentence explanation
- plan: Object with files_to_touch, risks, acceptance arrays
- diffs: Array of {path, unified_diff} objects 
- validator: Object with build, tests, lint, format_after arrays
- fix_plan_updates: Array of {id, patch} for any fix_plan.md updates

Format as clean JSON without markdown fences or extra text.
